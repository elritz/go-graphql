# GO-meetup A Go Graphql Experience

### Goal
The goal of this project is to Golang, GraphQL, JWT, and gqlgen by 99designs. 

### Outcomes
I built a basic chatroom platform, that use are bound with authentication an middleware using JWT tokens. 


### Relection
Using Gqlgen brings the sophistication of graphql down, simply it writes a lot of boilerplate in for you, making it easier to focus and execute queries, mutations and resolvers logic. Together GO, JWT, pg and gqlGen, open the door to ultimatley understanding database connection. Passing around pointers and context.

### Tech
- GO
- GraphQL
- Postgres
- JWT
